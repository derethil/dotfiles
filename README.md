# My Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles. They are highly personalized and I do not recommend installing the whole thing outright (if you are not me :)).

## Tooling

These dotfiles are designed around the following packages and tools:


- **Window Manager**: [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland)
- **Widgets**: [Aylur's Gtk Shell](https://github.com/Aylur/ags)
- **Editor**: [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) using [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)
- **Terminal**: [Foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/)
- **Shell**: [Fish](https://fishshell.com/)
- **File Manager**: [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf)
- **Prompt**: [Starship](https://starship.rs/)
- **Font**: [San Francisco](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/)

## Dotbot

This dotfiles setup is managed using Dotbot and some additional Dotbot plugins:

- [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) for managing dotfiles
- [Dotbot-yay](https://github.com/sobolevn/dotbot-asdf) for managing packages
- [Dotbot-asdf](https://github.com/OxSon/dotbot-yay/) for managing asdf plugins and versions
